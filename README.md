# Plant-disease-detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-Machine-Vision

This research presents a comprehensive study on the application of deep learning and machine vision techniques for the detection of plant leaf diseases in agricultural settings, specifically targeting farm village datasets. Three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models, namely VGG16 with transfer learning, ResNet50 with transfer learning, and InceptionNet V3, are employed for accurate and efficient disease classification. The proposed approach leverages the power of transfer learning to enhance the models' performance by fine-tuning pre-trained networks on the given datasets.

The study uses the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of 19,458 photos that have been hand-picked to improve plant disease identification through computer vision and deep learning. Data augmentation methods and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model provide an extra 9,973 augmented photos in order to improve dataset variety. 29,928 photos in all, divided into 20 different classifications that correspond to various plant health and disease categories, make up the full dataset. The dataset provides a rich depiction of plant conditions and spans a variety of crops, including blueberries, apples, cherries, corn, grapes, peppers, potatoes, and strawberries.
